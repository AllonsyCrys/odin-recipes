    <p>Creamy Heart Soups are made by Cooking a <em>Hydromelon</em>, a <em>Voltfruit</em>, <em>Fresh Milk</em>, and either a <em>Hearty Radish</em> or Big Hearty Radish</em> together in a Cooking Pot. 
        Soups made with a regular Hearty Radish <strong>heal eight Hearts</strong> to Link's Life Gauge and sell for 50 Rupees. 
        Soups made with Big Hearty Radishes heal eleven Hearts and sell for 70 Rupees. 
        Unlike many other Food, there are no variations of Creamy Heart Soup that grant additional affects. 
        These soups are known to be sweet, and sharing them is believed to bring two people closer together.</p>
