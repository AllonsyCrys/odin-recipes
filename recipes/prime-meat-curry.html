    <p>Prime Meat Curries can be made by Cooking Raw Prime Meat, Hylian Rice, and Goron Spice together in a Cooking Pot. 
     Link can eat these curries to have some of his Hearts to his Life Gauge.
     Since high-quality meat is used when making these meals, they have a deeper taste than other curries.</p>
